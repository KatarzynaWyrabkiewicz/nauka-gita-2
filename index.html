            ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
            Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
            All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
            And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>

            “Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
            The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
            Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
            The frumious Bandersnatch!”<br>

        <div class="verse">
            He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
            Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
            So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
            And stood awhile in thought.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
            The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
            Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
            And burbled as it came!<br>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
            The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
            He left it dead, and with its head<br>
            He went galumphing back.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            “And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
            Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
            O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br>
            He chortled in his joy.<br>
